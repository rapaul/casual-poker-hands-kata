Casual Poker Hands Kata
====

Casual poker hands is a Kata designed to promote descriptive readable test names.
The 'Casual' part is a bad joke around the lack of suits in the kata.
Cards purely have a numerical value, they don't belong to a suit.

e.g. a full house may be represented as : 1, 1, 1, 2, 2
